# App Actions fitness basic sample

## Codelab Start

For detailed instructions on using this code, refer to the [Extend an Android app with App Actions](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/appactions) codelab.

## App Sample Overview

This is a sample fitness application that allows displaying workout information as well as starting
and stopping a workout. By implementing [App Actions](https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/),
we allow the user to call upon our application to fulfill supported actions from our Health and fitness
vertical Assistant
[built-in intents (BIIs)](https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/reference/built-in-intents).

Specifically, this sample supports the following BIIs:
* `START_EXERCISE` - opens the sample app and starts an exercise session
* `STOP_EXERCISE` - opens the sample app and stops the current exercise session.
